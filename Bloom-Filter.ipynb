    "# <center> Bloom Filters - The Art of Searching Millions of Usernames to Return \"The username is taken. Try another\" </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are creating an account on Gmail, Facebook or Twitter you want to enter a cool username, you entered it and got a message, “Username is already taken”. You added your birth date along username, still no luck. Now you have added your university roll number also, still got “Username is already taken”. It’s really frustrating, isn’t it?\n",
    "But have you ever thought how quickly Gmail checks availability of username by searching millions of username registered with it. There are many ways to do this job:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - <b>Linear search</b>: Bad idea! Linear search is rarely practical because other search algorithms and schemes, such as the binary search algorithm and hash tables, allow significantly faster searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Let’s assume that Facebook stores all the data in its directory. And the software simply checks each name on the list one at a time and if it doesn’t find a match, it tells you your desired username is available.\n",
    "    Doesn’t sound sensible, does it?\n",
    "    The software has to look at each name every time a username needs to be verified. The technique is unreasonable when you compare it with the Facebook database, which has over 1.5 billion users, and Twitter, which has 300 million users.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "  - <b>Binary search</b>: Store all username alphabetically and compare entered username with middle one in list. If it matched, then username is taken otherwise figure out, whether entered username will come before or after middle one and if it will come after, neglect all the usernames before middle one(inclusive). Now search after middle one and repeat this process until you got a match or search end with no match. This technique is better and promising but still it requires multiple steps.\n",
    "  \n",
    "    In other view:\n",
    "    Facebook keeps all the data sorted and arranged in an alphabetized list. The list is 1.5 billion characters long, stored like a, aa,aaa……xyy, XYZ, yaa,yaa,yxz, zaa, zac and is very similar to your dictionary. When you enter a name, it matches the entry with the username exactly in the middle of the list. If it matches, the software rejects the new username. If it doesn’t match (which has a lot of possibilities), the next question the software addresses are “ If searched alphabetically, does the requested username come before or after this username in the middle?” If it comes before, then the software knows that all the 750 million people after the username found in the middle of the list is of no use for the current search. That eliminates 750 million possibilities in a single comparison. If the desired username comes after the name in the middle (alphabetically), it eliminates all the names before it. Either way, the software eliminates almost 750 million names for search in the first comparison. Next, it takes the selected half of the list and immediately matches the requested username with the name in the middle of the remaining list. If it matches, the requested name is rejected and if it doesn’t, the requested name is again checked for the possibility of it occurring before or after the name in the middle. If it is before, reject the 350 million names after the name. And go ahead with divide and conquer for the rest of the names as done earlier. If the requested name is after the middle string, reject the names before it and try with the 350 million remaining names. By dividing the list every time, you can compare the required username with the names in the list quite quickly…\n",

    "### Data Structures and Where to Find Them\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data structures are generally based on the ability of a computer to fetch and store data at any place in its memory, specified by a pointer—a bit string, representing a memory address, that can be itself stored in memory and manipulated by the program. Thus, the array and record data structures are based on computing the addresses of data items with arithmetic operations, while the linked data structures are based on storing addresses of data items within the structure itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of a data structure usually requires writing a set of procedures that create and manipulate instances of that structure. The efficiency of a data structure cannot be analyzed separately from those operations. This observation motivates the theoretical concept of an abstract data type, a data structure that is defined indirectly by the operations that may be performed on it, and the mathematical properties of those operations (including their space and time cost).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous types of data structures, generally built upon simpler primitive data types. Ley see the most commonly used data structures:\n",
    " * <i>Array</i> - A structure of fixed-size, which can hold items of the same data type. It can be an array of integers, an array of floating-point numbers, an array of strings or even an array of arrays (such as 2-dimensional arrays). Arrays are indexed, meaning that random access is possible.\n",
    " * <i>Linked Lists</i> - A linked list is a sequential structure that consists of a sequence of items in linear order which are linked to each other. Hence, you have to access data sequentially and random access is not possible. Linked lists provide a simple and flexible representation of dynamic sets.\n",
    " * <i>Record</i> - A record (also called tuple or struct) is an aggregate data structure. A record is a value that contains other values, typically in fixed number and sequence and typically indexed by names. The elements of records are usually called fields or members.\n",
    " * <i>Object</i> - An object is a data structure that contains data fields, like a record does, as well as various methods which operate on the data contents. An object is an in-memory instance of a class from a taxonomy. In the context of object-oriented programming, records are known as plain old data structures to distinguish them from objects.\n",
    " * <i>Stack</i> - A stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out — the element placed at last can be accessed at first) structure which can be commonly found in many programming languages. This structure is named as “stack” because it resembles a real-world stack — a stack of plates.\n",
    " * <i>Queues</i> - A queue is a FIFO (First In First Out — the element placed at first can be accessed at first) structure which can be commonly found in many programming languages. This structure is named as “queue” because it resembles a real-world queue — people waiting in a queue.\n",
    " * <i>Trees</i> - A tree is a hierarchical structure where data is organized hierarchically and are linked together. This structure is different from a linked list whereas, in a linked list, items are linked in a linear order.\n",
    " * <i>Heaps</i> - A Heap is a special case of a binary tree where the parent nodes are compared to their children with their values and are arranged accordingly.\n",
    " * <i>Graphs</i> - A graph consists of a finite set of vertices or nodes and a set of edges connecting these vertices. The order of a graph is the number of vertices in the graph. The size of a graph is the number of edges in the graph. Two nodes are said to be adjacent if they are connected to each other by the same edge.\n",
    " \n",
    " There are also some more complex structures and we are going to meet two of them up close.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " * <i>Probabilistic data structures</i> - Probabilistic data structures are a group of data structures that are extremely useful for big data and streaming applications. Generally speaking, these data structures use hash functions to randomize and compactly represent a set of items. Collisions are ignored but errors can be well-controlled under certain threshold. Comparing with error-free approaches, these algorithms use much less memory and have constant query time. They usually support union and intersection operations and therefore can be easily parallelized.\n",
    " * <i>Hash Tables</i> - A Hash Table is a data structure that stores values which have keys associated with each of them.\n"

    "\n",
    "In order to understand the <i>Bloom filter</i>, we need to have some basic knowledge about <i>Hash Tables</i> and <i>Hash Functions</i>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Direct Addressing uses the one-to-one mapping between the values and keys when storing in a table. However, there is a problem with this approach when there is a large number of key-value pairs. The table will be huge with so many records and may be impractical or even impossible to be stored, given the memory available on a typical computer. To avoid this issue we use <i>hash tables</i>.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we described above, the  <b>Hash Table</b> is a data structure that stores values which have keys associated with each of them. Furthermore, it supports lookup efficiently if we know the key associated with the value. Hence it is very efficient in inserting and searching, irrespective of the size of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A special function named as the <b>hash function ($h$)</b> is used to overcome the aforementioned problem in direct addressing.\n",
    "In direct accessing, a value with key <b>$k$</b> is stored in the slot <b>$k$</b>. Using the hash function, we calculate the index of the table (slot) to which each value goes. The value calculated using the hash function for a given key is called the <b>hash value</b> which indicates the index of the table to which the value is mapped.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h(k) = k\\%m$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $h$ - Hash function\n",
    "* $k$ - Key of which the hash value should be determined\n",
    "* $m$ - Size of the hash table (number of slots available). A prime value that is not close to an exact power of 2 is a good choice for $m$.\n",

    "<img src=\"./images/hash_table.png\">\n",

    "> <center><em> Fig 1. Representation of a Hash Function </em></center>\n",

We can resolve collisions by selecting a suitable hash function $h$ and use techniques such as <b>chaining</b> and <b>open addressing</b>. We are going to learn more for these techniques in the next project."

    "### What is Bloom Filter?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Bloom filter is <b>a space-efficient probabilistic data structure</b> that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. For example, checking availability of username is set membership problem, where the set is the list of all registered username. The price we pay for efficiency is that it is probabilistic in nature that means, there might be some False Positive results. <b>False positive means, it might tell that given username is already taken but actually it’s not.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lets see some interesting properties of Bloom Filters  \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike a standard hash table, a Bloom filter of a fixed size can represent a set with an arbitrarily large number of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding an element never fails. However, the false positive rate increases steadily as elements are added until all bits in the filter are set to 1, at which point all queries yield a positive result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bloom filters never generate <b>false negative</b> result, i.e., telling you that a username doesn’t exist when it actually exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deleting elements from filter is not possible because, if we delete a single element by clearing bits at indices generated by k hash functions, it might cause deletion of few other elements. Example – if we delete “geeks” (in given example below) by clearing bit at 1, 4 and 7, we might end up deleting “nerd” also Because bit at index 4 becomes 0 and bloom filter claims that “nerd” is not present.\n"

    "This meens that 'twiter' was not included in the provided data, but was considered as posible to be there. The Bloom Filter cuts it, to insure that in is not included for sure. The absurd thing is that if you are not lucky, there is a 0.05 probability that your dream username will be rejected by mistake (as false positive) as 'twitter' was rejected above.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can control the false positive by controlling the size of the Bloom filter.\n",
    "More space is inversely proportional to false positives. We need to take a bit array of some specific size that is solely we need to assume for the system how much users will come into our system.\n",
    "\n",
    "With technology and computers getting smarter and faster every day, even the brute-force method seems feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "But with space and time complexity, many companies, such as Reddit, prefer Binary search, whereas some others, such as Medium, use Bloom filters smartly to suggest articles for you without repeating them again on your timeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bloom Filters is already used by a lot of databases like Cassandra, Postgres, HBase etc. and it is used by Google Chrome for detecting malicious websites. Basically it keeps all the malicious urls on chrome and before rendering and going to page it checks on this list with bloom filters and returns safety concerns if any.\n",
